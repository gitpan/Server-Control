NAME
    Server::Control -- Flexible apachectl style control for servers

VERSION
    version 0.20

SYNOPSIS
        use Server::Control::Apache;

        my $apache = Server::Control::Apache->new(
            conf_file => '/my/apache/dir/conf/httpd.conf'
        );
        if ( !$apache->is_running() ) {
            $apache->start();
        }

DESCRIPTION
    `Server::Control' allows you to control servers in the spirit of
    apachectl, where a server is any background process which listens to a
    port and has a pid file. It is designed to be subclassed for different
    types of servers.

    The original motivation was to eliminate all those little annoyances
    that can occur when starting and stopping a server doesn't quite go
    right.

FEATURES
    *   Checks server status in multiple ways (looking for an active
        process, contacting the server's port)

    *   Detects and handles corrupt or out-of-date pid files

    *   Tails the error log when server fails to start

    *   Uses sudo by default when using restricted (< 1024) port

    *   Reports what is listening to a port when it is busy (with
        Unix::Lsof)

AVAILABLE SUBCLASSES
    The following subclasses are currently available as part of this
    distribution:

    *   Server::Control::Apache - For Apache httpd

    *   Server::Control::Nginx - For Nginx

    *   Server::Control::Starman - For Starman

    *   Server::Control::HTTPServerSimple - For HTTP::Server::Simple

    *   Server::Control::NetServer - For Net::Server

    There may be other subclasses available on CPAN.

RELATED MODULES
    *   App::Control - Same basic idea for any application with a pid file.
        No features specific to a server listening on a port, and not easily
        subclassable, as all commands are handled in a single case
        statement.

    *   MooseX::Control - A Moose role for controlling applications with a
        pid file. Nice extendability. No features specific to a server
        listening on a port, and assumes server starts via a command-line
        (unlike pure-Perl servers, say). May end up using this role.

    *   Nginx::Control, Sphinx::Control, Lighttpd::Control - Modules which
        use MooseX::Control
